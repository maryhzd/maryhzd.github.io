## Biography

Hello! I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher specializing in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) and Artificial Intelligence for Science
(AI4Science), with a PhD in Computational Mechanics from Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on integrating
machine learning and artificial intelligence with computational mechanics to accelerate numerical simulations and tackle
complex computational challenges in engineering. My current research area focuses on developing neural operators and
diffusion models for SciML tasks.

My PhD research centered on phase-field fracture modeling, computational mechanics, and numerical methods. I also applied
machine learning and data science techniques to solve structural, heat transfer, and other mechanical problems.


My PhD research was advised by Professor <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/cee/people/faculty/dayal.html">Kaushik Dayal</a>
 and Professor <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/cee/people/faculty/rounce.html">David Rounce</a>. 
 
My postdoc research is advised by Professor <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/somdatta-goswami/">Somdatta Goswami</a> and Proffesor <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/lori-brady/">Lori Graham-Brady</a>.
